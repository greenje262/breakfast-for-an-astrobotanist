BREAKFAST FOR AN ASTROBOTANIST

Core mechanic
    Physics-based throwing

Core gameplay loop
    Player has a finite amount of food to throw to plants, feeding all plants clears the level, allowing the scientist to get close

Intended player experience
    Learning game physics to make shots count, probably will only play through once or twice
    Each "level" is another section of the space station

Theme
    High-tech, spacey, set on a space station

Primary features
    Player, plant, and food sprites
        The food is an animal (could be non-descript meat-looking stuff)
        I'm imagining pirahna plant or pitcher plant style plants
        Player is a lab-coat-wearing badass, with a food-pitching animation
    Physics-based throwing mechanic
    Once fed, plants are satiated (they provide the materials needed to make the food?)

Secondary features
    Main menu, level select, game over
    Multiple levels, space station environment
    Player wind-up to throw farther, associated sprites
    Music, sound effects
    Variable gravity

Polish
    Intro cutscene
    Different kinds of plants
    Voice acting
    'Success!' sprites

What do I need to learn?
    Loading different scenes in Godot
    Making and using a tileset to build levels
    How to tie an animation to button input (for the wind-up effect)
    How to set gravity, etc. to be different in certain spaces (area node?)
    How to configure control nodes (button color, etc.)
